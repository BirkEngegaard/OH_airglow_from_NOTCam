# OH_airglow_from_NOTCam

This is the full coding framework used in my master's thesis. Raw data is not added in this repository, but some example data is found 
in the folder NCwb19.

Anyone interested in using this code for OH airglow studies are encouraged to contact me at birkengegaard@gmail.com. 
I can then prepare some simplified example scripts and help you get started.

Best,
Birk Engeg√•rd
